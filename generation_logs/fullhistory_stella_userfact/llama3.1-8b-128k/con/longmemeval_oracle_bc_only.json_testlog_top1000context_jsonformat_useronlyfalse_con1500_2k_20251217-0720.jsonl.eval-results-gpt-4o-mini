From April 16th to May 6th is 20 days. Therefore, the total number of days from April 1st to May 6th is 35 days.\n\nTo convert this to weeks, we can divide by 7:\n\n* 35 days \u00f7 7 = approximately 5 weeks\n\nHowever, since the user downloaded the app on April 16th and not on April 1st, we need to subtract the number of days from April 1st to April 16th (15 days) from the total number of days.

In Session 1, the user mentions getting a great deal on their favorite author's book, but doesn't provide the exact discounted price. However, in Session 2, it is mentioned that the user got the book for $24 after a discount.\n\nWe can infer from Session 2 that the original price of the book was likely higher than $24, since the user mentions getting a discount. Given that the original price was $30 (from Session 1), we can assume that the discounted price of $24 is indeed lower than the original price.\n\nTo calculate the percentage discount, we need to know the amount of the discount. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in either session. However, since the user mentions getting a great deal and the discounted price is significantly lower than the original price ($30 - $24 = $6), it's likely that the discount was substantial.\n\n**Step 3: Provide an answer based on the analysis**\n\nWhile we can't determine the exact percentage of the discount, we can infer that the user received a significant discount. Based on the information provided, I would estimate that the percentage discount is likely in the range of 20-30% (since $6 is approximately 20-25% of the original price).
