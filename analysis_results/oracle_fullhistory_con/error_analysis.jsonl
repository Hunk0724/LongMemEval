The fact that they mentioned seeing interesting projects on AI in education suggests that they were actively participating in the conference, which is consistent with presenting a research project.\n\n**Step 3: Draw a conclusion**\n\nBased on the information extracted and reasoned over, I conclude that the user presented their poster for their undergrad course research project at Harvard University.", "prompt": null, "prompt_tokens": 302, "completion_tokens": 153, "total_tokens": 465, "answer_session_ids": ["answer_ef84b994_abs_1", "answer_ef84b994_abs_2"], "haystack_session_ids": ["answer_ef84b994_abs_1", "answer_ef84b994_abs_2"], "evidence_count": 2, "eval_model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "eval_reasoning": "N/A"}
